## About

My modification of the [custom system fetching tool written in bash script](https://github.com/mngshm/rxfetch).

## Requirements

- Material design icons as for that pacman and ghost icons.
- You need to put the provided fonts in the fonts directory to get the icons work.
- If wanted you can change the source code of the fetch as per your needs.
- If you already use material-design-icons you can just use the command below to install it.

## Quick Installation

You can install rxfetch with this one-line command:

```yaml
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocketmike12/rxfetch-arch/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

For Termux users:
```yaml
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocketmike12/rxfetch-arch/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Run with curl

If you don't wanna clone this repo or install rxfetch, you can use curl.

```yaml
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocketmike12/rxfetch-arch/main/rxfetch | bash
```
